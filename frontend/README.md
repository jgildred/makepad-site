# makepad-site-frontend
 The Makepad frontend for makepad-site. This app requires Makepad installed in order to build.

 This app will build for WASM target as part of the makepad-site build, but you can also build it as a standalone app for any platform that Makepad supports.

 cargo run

 See the readme file in the makepad root directory for instruction on building for other targets.
